                <p>
                    Hi. My name is Kimberly. I’m currently a Copywriter based in Minneapolis. I’ve always enjoyed storytelling and crafting meaningful communications that amplify and inspire action.
                    Through my work experience, I’ve had opportunities to dip my toe into user-design and I loved it. UX blends my love of writing, my natural curiosity, desire to help people, and my new interest in visual design. It is the perfect sequel to my next chapter.
